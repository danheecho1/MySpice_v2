                <p class="about_content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something unique about the feeling of friction between lead and paper when you write - it's different from when you tap on your iPad screen. What about driving a car with a manual transmission versus an automatic? Traditional classroom settings with your peers around you versus virtual classes and meetings on screens? How about the old SNS like Myspace versus a jungle of unwanted information and ads that SNS has become?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myspice is my attempt at recreating Myspace with simpler design and fewer key features. There are no ads or games that send out annoying invites.. Or public announcements saying that I stalked a pretty girl and accidentally liked one of her photos.</p>

                <p class="about_content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frontend portion of Myspice was made using HTML, CSS, and minimal amount of plain JS (no React, Angular, Vue, etc).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The backend was written in Python (using Flask and Jinja). My database of choice for this project was MySQL because I felt like I needed a relational database in order to model friendship statuses among users.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myspice also uses <a target="_blank" href="https://cloudinary.com">Cloudinary</a> in order to upload and store images, retrieve unique image URLs, and store those URLs into the database. This was an alternative to my initial setup where images would be uploaded to local machines.</p>

                <p class="about_content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Weeks of coding can save you hours of planning." This knowledge that I had only heard of turned into wisdom I learned the hard way. With a rough list of MVP features and a wireframe, I rushed into coding thinking it would be better to start and run into problems quickly than spend too much time planning. Looking back now, I wish I spent more time thinking about the following items prior to coding: ERD, sitemap/URLs, detailed notes on what information is rendered where, and a <b>timeline</b>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a similar note, I felt the importance of writing well-organized, readable, and maintainable codes firsthand. Myspice has only 17 HTML pages and 6 tables in the database, and yet I made a hot mess jungle of class/id names and class methods. If I work on bigger projects, who knows what that jungle might become..? In my future projects, I will be more mindful of ways to stay organized/structured and utilize effective modularization. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure if this is a standard practice or a taboo, but I tried using separate CSS files for each HTML page instead of having one giant CSS file for all pages. I did so to avoid CSS codes affecting wrong elements possibly from different HTML pages. It worked as intended, but all of my CSS files now have about 150 lines of the same code. I will need to try mixing this idea with CSS variables and BEM to stay a bit less redundant and more organized. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, Myspice was a fun, humbling, challenging, and rewarding project. It opened my eyes to many different concepts, frameworks, thought processes, and possibilities I did not know of. I also tasted the euphoria of successful debugging and problem solving (however insignificant or minimal they may be), and I will need some more. I could definitely be doing this line of work for a living.</p>
